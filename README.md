# Project3 - Little Scribbles

## Project Overview

Creating a blog-styled website to showcase my articles from Medium.

## Motivation

The greatest developers write blogs to establish credibility. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Tech/frameworks Used

Built with 

* Nextjs
* GraphQL

### Features

Nothing spectacularly different - very simple design. 

### Approach Taken

Began by using Graphcms to write my content and create the models within the schema. Then proceeded to fetch the api and structure the layout of the articles in javascript. 

### Difficulties encountered when building this

A few hiccups here and there due to typos and api integration. 

### Credits & Acknowledgements 
A special thanks to Joel, CJ, Mark & Tina for helping me flesh this out and iron out any bugs that I came across whilst building this.
